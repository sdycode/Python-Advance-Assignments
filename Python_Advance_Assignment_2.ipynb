        "A class is used to define a blueprint for a given object, whereas a module is used to reuse a given piece of code inside another program.\n",
        "A class can have its own instance, but a module cannot be instantiated. We use the ‘class’ keyword to define a class, whereas to use modules, we use the ‘import’ keyword.\n",
        "Modules are files present inside a package, whereas a class is used to encapsulate data and functions together inside the same unit.\n",

        "class variables & function definations\n",
        "An instance can be created using class name by writing class name with ()\n",
        "which will call __init__ method automatically.\n",
        "An instance created will be assigned to reference variable can be used further.\n",

        "The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class.\n",
